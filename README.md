# ForNAV Training Material

Welcome to the trainer guide to the ForNAV training material. Please use this material as a guide. What matters is that your students will be able to create great looking and easy to use reports. Please make sure you adapt your training methods and materials to the level of the students taking the course.

## Training method

Each section of the training course can be divided in three parts, preparation, execution, and reflection. This will ensure that students will have a good mix of all these parts. 
Trainers behavior during the parts:

**Preparation**. Make sure the students know what it is you are asking from them. Run through the exercise and ask questions to see if the students know what it is you are asking from them. Help the students plan their work. Create a rough outline or design of what the students are going to be doing. Any theoretical knowledge should be given in this section.

**Execution**. Mostly coaching. Let students do their own work. Let them make mistakes and let them fix themselves. Walk around to see what each student is doing and ask open questions about the work you see. The point here is to have the students work with the software, not to have them execute flawless work. Questions like “what is the reason of…” or “how will that…” are ideal as they make the students think about what they are doing.
In some cases, a module will start with an exercise. In this case the point is to make the students use the skills from the previous modules to complete the exercise. If students struggle with the exercise you can give a quick demo, point students to a ForNAV standard report, give them the C/AL code text files, or even give them the cheat sheets. The point of this is to get the students to think about what they want to do and how to solve it. This training method may be uncomfortable, but it will promote problem solving ability.

**Reflection**. Walk through the completed exercise with the students. If the students are comfortable with it let them present their own work and discuss with the group. If not, then ask questions like “How did you solve this?”. Run through the “perfect example” with the students but realize that there is more than one solution to any problem, so students might do something different and get perfect results. If so ask questions and keep an open mind.
There is no prescribed order of these parts. In the course material we usually work from Preparation to Reflection but there is no problem with starting with an exercise, reflecting on that and finally have students plan or design a more advanced report.

A further training method that was used in creating these modules is repetition. If you look through the modules you will notice that as the students advance they will keep on working with reports they worked on before. This is done to create a repetition element that will ensure that students can link new knowledge and skills to existing knowledge and skills thus ensuring better retention.

## Modules
There are many parts to the ForNAV training material. Some more advanced than others. When planning your days of training you should mind the level of the students. Do they have a technical background? Do they know NAV at all? Always check with your students to see of the level is suitable. If not, then switch to more or less advanced options.

There are two ready made tracks. The classroom training ([No Code](/Modules/Classroom%20NoCode.md) and [Developer](Modules/Classroom%20Developer.md)). And the webinar series ([No Code](Modules/Webinar%20NoCode.md) and [Developer](/Modules/Webinar%20Developer.md)). The webinar series uses the same modules as the classroom training but they are condensed in a smaller number of sessions. The webinar series uses video and exercises to facilitate self study.

## Prerequisites

All students have access to a Business Central instance (OnPrem or SaaS) with the Cronus Database with a valid license. All students have the ForNAV designer installed in the same environment.
