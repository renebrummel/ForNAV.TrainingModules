### Video script
Hi and welcome to this Reports ForNAV training. We will start the training with the installation and setup of Reports ForNAV. The installation and Setup of ForNAV comes in two types, Cloud and On Premise. Please use the setup that is suitable for your installation type. Finally we will discuss the setup of the Customizable Report Pack. This is the same for both installation types.

**ForNAV Designer**

When we want to edit and create ForNAV reports we need to install the ForNAV Designer. You can download the latest version from the ForNAV website.

DEMO

*Install the ForNAV Designer.*

**Cloud**

The installation of ForNAV cloud starts with the installation of the Customizable Report Pack in your Business Central Tenant. This will install everything you need to run, edit, and create ForNAV reports.

DEMO

*Using a new sandbox Install the Customizable Report Pack from the Marketplace. Show which extensions are installed.*

The next step is to connect the ForNAV Designer to the Business Central tenant so it can read table and field information, load and save reports, and manage extensions.

DEMO

*Set up the ForNAV Designer to connect to Business Central Cloud.*

Once we have done this we are ready to work with ForNAV.

**On Premise**

The installation of ForNAV cloud starts with the installation of the ForNAV Service Add In on your Business Central Service tiers. This will install the dll that ForNAV reports needs to render the layouts.

DEMO

*Install the ForNAV Designer Service Add In.*

The next step is to connect the ForNAV Designer to the Business Central service tier so it can read table and field information, load and save reports, and manage extensions. For this we need to ensure that the SOAP, OData, API, and developer ports are open.

DEMO

*Set up the ForNAV Designer to connect to Business Central On Prem. Show which extensions are installed on the server.*

Once we have set up the ForNAV Designer correctly we can install the ForNAV Customizable Report Pack. This is not mandatory but it is highly recommended.

DEMO

*Download and install the Customizable Report Pack extension and upload it to the server using the Designer. Show which extensions are installed.*

Once we have done this we are ready to work with ForNAV.


**Setup of the ForNAV Customizable Report Pack**

After installing the ForNAV Customizable Report Pack you can set it up so the ForNAV reports get added to your report selection, and add your logo, payment terms, etc.
