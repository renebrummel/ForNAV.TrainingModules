## Pre Training
Watch the video []()

## Preparation
Duration:

What are we going to do

Demo totaling by adding the Line.Amount field to the Sales Template Line footer. Demonstrate the automatic addition of these fields to the List."Total Fields" property. Also demonstrate the adding of totals to the quantity field in the footer.

Explain the way ForNAV calculates and displays totals.

Using the Sales template explain the way TransHeaders + TransFooter behave.

## Execution
Duration:

[filename](../../Exercises/Transport.Exercise.md ':include')

## Reflection
Duration:

* What happened to the Subtotal fields on the Transport Header? Why are they hidden?
* What other type of totaling might we use?
