## Pre Training
Watch the video []()

## Preparation
Duration:

What are we going to do

Demo totalling by adding the Line.Amount field to the Sales Template Line footer. Demonstrate the automatic addition of these fields to the List."Total Fields" property.

Explain the way ForNAV calculates and displays totals. Explain totals can only be added in sections on the same DataItem level. Line totals cannot be dsiplayed in the Header footer etc.

Using the Sales template explain the way TransHeaders + TransFooter behave.

## Execution
Duration:

[filename](../../Exercises/Transport.Exercise.md ':include')

## Reflection
Duration:

* What happened to the Subtotal fields on the Transport Header? Why are they hidden?
* What other type of totalling might we use?
