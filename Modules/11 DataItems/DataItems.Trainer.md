## Preparation
Duration:

> Demonstrate using the Customer List Report

* Add the "Sales Header" table with the "Sell To Customer No." as DataItem link. Filter "Document Type" on "Order"
* Add Header and body with the fields:
  * No
  * Doc Date
  * Status
  * Make the header and body blue so they stand out a bit.
* Sort by Doc Date in order descending
* Add the Amount header and field. Double check calculated field
* Add a footer section with totals for the Amount field

Explain how DataItems behave when you edit the report layout and when you edit the extension.
